title: Performance of green concrete pipes made exclusively from carbon-activated steel slag 
summary: 'Concrete pipe is an important infrastructure product and is traditionally made of Portland cement. Production of one tonne of cement requires several tonnes of raw materials, such as limestone and clay, not only consuming energy but also emitting tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). To make concrete pipe carbon-negative “green” product, it is crucial that Portland cement be replaced by an alternate binder in the process. Steel slag is a waste generated from the steel refining process and has never been considered a stand-alone binder in the production of construction products due to its poor hydraulic properties. The method developed at McGill University uses the carbonation activation technique to make steel slag a primary binder for construction applications. The use of steel slag as a primary binder in construction products will eliminate the use of Portland cement, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, convert industry wastes into value-added products, sequester carbon dioxide into stable carbonates, and consume zero natural resources. It has been successfully applied to masonry block production marketed by Carbicrete Inc. This Alliance project investigates the possibility of producing concrete pipes using a carbon-activated steel slag system through carbonation curing.'
