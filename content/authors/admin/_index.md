Dr. Xian Xiangping will become an Assistant Professor in the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering (ACE) at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU). Before joining CityU, he works as a full-time postdoctoral researcher at McGill University, supervised by Prof. Yixin Shao. Dr. Xian Xiangping received his Bachelor of Engineering with first-class honours from Shenzhen University in 2013., attained his Master’s and Ph.D. degrees in Civil Engineering from McGill University in 2017 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, he was also one of Marie Sklodowska-Curie Future Roads Fellow recipients from Cambridge University. His research is mainly about producing green cement-based products made from OPC, industrial wastes (i.e., steel slag), municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues, etc. through Carbon, Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), typically via early-age carbonation curing. Beyond that, he is also interested in automation construction, 3D printing of green construction materials, and so on.
